# San-Francisco-Data-Project

#### San Francisco is a city full of problems and potential.

## Why this Project?

The Pandemic has only created greater disparities between those who come here for the opportunity and those who struggle to survive.
For the amount of money generated by the ever increasing number of tech companies, the streets are full of people in need with no real fundamental changes.

The consequences of inequality:
- Increased Poverty
- Increased Crime
- Increased Drug Abuse
- Increased Mental Illness

The objective of this project is to understand the city and find actionable insights to help San Francisco reach its potential.
